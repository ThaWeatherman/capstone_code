\section{Experiment}

In our study we will attempt to detect both tunneling and generated names in observed DNS traffic.
We use a data set totalling roughly $30 MB$ of data collected from the Johns Hopkins
University Information Security Institute (JHUISI) network.
The data was properly anonymized prior to use so as to protect the privacy of individuals on the network.
It was collected using the tool $tcpdump$ by the network administrator.
The data consists only of DNS queries and responses.
