Hackers employ many tools in their nefarious practices.
Hash crackers, Metasploit, or SQL injection are just some of these tools.
An often overlooked tool is DNS\@.
Hackers will use DNS packets to exfiltrate data from targets or to communicate with their implants.
They also use malicious domain names to harden communications for their malware or to capitalize on typographical errors.
Detecting this malicious usage of DNS involves maintaining a white list or other basic detection techniques.
Machine learning is the new frontier in all aspects of Computer Science.
It is especially useful for detection techniques in the realm of security.
In this paper, we explore the application of Semi-Supervised machine learning to the detection of malicious uses of DNS\@.
Using multiple algorithms, we prove that machine learning is an effective technique for detecting new and continuing threats
presented through the use of DNS\@.
